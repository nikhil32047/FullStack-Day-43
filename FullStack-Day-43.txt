Day 43:
===========

a) Pickling (Packing)
=============================
Pickling is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream so it can be stored in a file or transferred over a network.
Python provides the pickle module for this purpose.

Example:
import pickle

data = {"name": "Nikhil", "age": 22}

with open("data.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)

Key Points:
Stores complex objects (lists, dicts, objects)
File opened in binary write (wb) mode
Used for object persistence


b) Unpickling (Unpacking)
================================
Unpickling is the process of converting the byte stream back into the original Python object.

Example:
import pickle

with open("data.pkl", "rb") as f:
    obj = pickle.load(f)

print(obj)

Key Points:
File opened in binary read (rb) mode
Restores original object structure
⚠️ Avoid unpickling data from untrusted sources
